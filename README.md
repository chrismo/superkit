# SuperKit (Archived)

This repo is archived. SuperKit was a SuperDB function library, CLI tool suite,
and collection of tutorial docs for [SuperDB](https://superdb.org/).

All content (recipes, grok patterns, tutorials, test examples) has moved to
[superdb-mcp](https://github.com/chrismo/superdb-mcp), which serves this
material through the SuperDB MCP server for use with coding agents.

`changelog.jsup` is kept here for historical reference.
