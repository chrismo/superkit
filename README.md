# SuperKit

The SuperKit library is a collection of common Operators and Functions for the
`zq`, `zed`, and `super` tools. `zq`/`zed` were renamed to SuperDB after version
1.18 of `zq`/`zed`.
                            
It also contains additional docs and descriptive tests as a supplement to the
official documentation.

## Repo Structure

Ops and functions can be in any number of different files, with test files
side-by-side.

The release process will produce a single combined file that will be installed
into the home directory of the user executing the install.sh script.
